        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 100px 275px;"> I'm Imran Radzi, currently an undergraduate
        in Mathematics in their penultimate year. I thought of building a website for myself after
        starting to learn about HTML, CSS and Javascript (and hopefully other languages as well!).
        As of now, this website is mainly a 'test site' of sorts for me, although I may be using it
        to document more of the things I learn along the way.</p>
